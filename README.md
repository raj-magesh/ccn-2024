Hey!

If you're here, you probably scanned the QR code on my poster at CCN (Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience) 2022. This repository contains my poster (linked below) if you want to take a closer look at it. If you have any comments, suggestions, questions or general feedback, please contact me (Raj) at rgautha1@jh.edu!

Thanks for your interest! :D
